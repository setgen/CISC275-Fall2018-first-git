1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?

	A list of Dog objects called 'dogs' is created first, then three dog objects are created and then placed in the list. Finally, an instance of a Comparator class is created inside of the sort method.

3. Can you spot the comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the comparator?

	The entire class definition of comparator is inside of the method call of Collections.sort. The comparator constructor call is first directly after 'dogs,' and then the definition and overriding of the compare method occurs directly afterwards.
